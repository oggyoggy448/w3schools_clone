# w3schools clone
A single page application had been developed as the part of my portfolio that contains main page of w3schools [website](https://www.w3schools.com/).


# How to use
Download Any code editor. My recommendation is to use visual studio code. Use this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Download this project and 
open it and run the index.html by double clicking on the page.
